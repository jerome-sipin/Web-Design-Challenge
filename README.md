This is my (Jerome Sipin)'s submission for the web design homework.

Each page's html file is named exactly for its purpose (e.g. "max_temperature.html"
will contain the chart for latitude vs max temperature).

I feel like I could have done a lot better on this assignment, but I had a lot
on my plate this week, and I already have a previous dislike of web design, which
led to me really putting this assignment off. Other than some minor details, I believe
the site should hold up to the requirements of the assignment.
